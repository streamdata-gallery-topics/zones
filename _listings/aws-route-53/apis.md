name: AWS Route 53
x-slug: aws-route-53
description: Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable cloud Domain Name
  System (DNS) web service. It is designed to give developers and businesses an extremely
  reliable and cost effective way to route end users to Internet applications by translating
  names like www.example.com into the numeric IP addresses like 192.0.2.1 that computers
  use to connect to each other. Amazon Route 53 is fully compliant with IPv6 as well.Amazon
  Route 53 effectively connects user requests to infrastructure running in AWS &ndash;
  such as Amazon EC2 instances, Elastic Load Balancing load balancers, or Amazon S3
  buckets &ndash; and can also be used to route users to infrastructure outside of
  AWS. You can use Amazon Route 53 to configure DNS health checks to route traffic
  to healthy endpoints or to independently monitor the health of your application
  and its endpoints. Amazon Route 53 Traffic Flow makes it easy for you to manage
  traffic globally through a variety of routing types, including Latency Based Routing,
  Geo DNS, and Weighted Round Robin&mdash;all of which can be combined with DNS Failover
  in order to enable a variety of low-latency, fault-tolerant architectures. Using
  Amazon Route 53 Traffic Flow&rsquo;s simple visual editor, you can easily manage
  how your end-users are routed to your application&rsquo;s endpoints&mdash;whether
  in a single AWS region or distributed around the globe. Amazon Route 53 also offers
  Domain Name Registration &ndash; you can purchase and manage domain names such as
  example.com and Amazon Route 53 will automatically configure DNS settings for your
  domains.

    GETrequest to the /2013-04-01/hostedzone resource. The response to this requestincludes
    a HostedZones child element for each hosted zone created by the currentAWS account.Amazon
    Route 53 returns a maximum of 100 items in each response. If you have a lot of
    hostedzones, you can use the maxitems parameter to list them in groups of up to
    100.The response includes four values that help navigate from one group of maxitemshosted
    zones to the next:                  MaxItems is the value specified for the maxitems
    parameterin the request that produced the current response.If the value of IsTruncated
    in the response is true, there are morehosted zones associated with the current
    AWS account.                   NextMarker is the hosted zone ID of the next hosted
    zone that isassociated with the current AWS account. If you want to list more
    hosted zones, makeanother call to ListHostedZones, and specify the value of theNextMarker
    element in the marker parameter. If IsTruncated is false, the NextMarker element
    isomitted from the response.If you''re making the second or subsequent call to
    ListHostedZones, theMarker element matches the value that you specified in themarker

    aHostedZones child element for each hosted zone created by the current AWSaccount.             ListHostedZonesByName
    sorts hosted zones by name with the labels reversed.For example:                  com.example.www.               Note
    the trailing dot, which can change the sort order in some circumstances.If the
    domain name includes escape characters or Punycode,ListHostedZonesByName alphabetizes
    the domain name using the escaped orPunycoded value, which is the format that
    Amazon Route 53 saves in its database. For example, to createa hosted zone for
    example.com, specify ex\344mple.com for the domain name.ListHostedZonesByName
    alphabetizes it as:                  com.ex\344mple.               The labels
