name: AWS Route 53
description: Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable cloud Domain Name
  System (DNS) web service. It is designed to give developers and businesses an extremely
  reliable and cost effective way to route end users to Internet applications by translating
  names like www.example.com into the numeric IP addresses like 192.0.2.1 that computers
  use to connect to each other. Amazon Route 53 is fully compliant with IPv6 as well.nAmazon
  Route 53 effectively connects user requests to infrastructure running in AWS ndash;
  such as Amazon EC2 instances, Elastic Load Balancing load balancers, or Amazon S3
  buckets ndash; and can also be used to route users to infrastructure outside of
  AWS. You can use Amazon Route 53 to configure DNS health checks to route traffic
  to healthy endpoints or to independently monitor the health of your application
  and its endpoints. Amazon Route 53 Traffic Flow makes it easy for you to manage
  traffic globally through a variety of routing types, including Latency Based Routing,
  Geo DNS, and Weighted Round Robinmdash;all of which can be combined with DNS Failover
  in order to enable a variety of low-latency, fault-tolerant architectures. Using
  Amazon Route 53 Traffic Flowrsquo;s simple visual editor, you can easily manage
  how your end-users are routed to your applicationrsquo;s endpointsmdash;whether
  in a single AWS region or distributed around the globe. Amazon Route 53 also offers
  Domain Name Registration ndash; you can purchase and manage domain names such as
  example.com and Amazon Route 53 will automatically configure DNS settings for your
  domains.
