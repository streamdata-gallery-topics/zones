			"description": "The AWS CloudHSM service helps you meet corporate, contractual and regulatory compliance requirements for data security by using dedicated Hardware Security Module (HSM) appliances within the AWS cloud. With CloudHSM, you control the encryption keys and cryptographic operations performed by the HSM.AWS and AWS Marketplace partners offer a variety of solutions for protecting sensitive data within the AWS platform, but for applications and data subject to rigorous contractual or regulatory requirements for managing cryptographic keys, additional protection is sometimes necessary. Until now, your only option was to store the sensitive data (or the encryption keys protecting the sensitive data) in your on-premises datacenters. Unfortunately, this either prevented you from migrating these applications to the cloud or significantly slowed their performance. The AWS CloudHSM service allows you to protect your encryption keys within HSMs designed and validated to government standards for secure key management. You can securely generate, store, and manage the cryptographic keys used for data encryption such that they are accessible only by you. AWS CloudHSM helps you comply with strict key management requirements without sacrificing application performance.The AWS CloudHSM service works with Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). CloudHSM instances are provisioned inside your VPC with an IP address that you specify, providing simple and private network connectivity to your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances. Placing CloudHSM instances near your EC2 instances decreases network latency, which can improve application performance. AWS provides dedicated and exclusive (single tenant) access to CloudHSM instances, isolated from other AWS customers. Available in multiple Regions and Availability Zones (AZs), AWS CloudHSM allows you to add secure and durable key storage to your applications.",

Amazon EC2 reduces the time required to obtain and boot new server instances to minutes, allowing you to quickly scale capacity, both up and down, as your computing requirements change. Amazon EC2 changes the economics of computing by allowing you to pay only for capacity that you actually use.

It is designed to give developers and businesses an extremely reliable and cost effective way to route end users to Internet applications by translating names like www.example.com into the numeric IP addresses like 192.0.2.1 that computers use to connect to each other. Amazon Route 53 is fully compliant with IPv6 as well.Amazon Route 53 effectively connects user requests to infrastructure running in AWS &ndash; such as Amazon EC2 instances, Elastic Load Balancing load balancers, or Amazon S3 buckets &ndash; and can also be used to route users to infrastructure outside of AWS. You can use Amazon Route 53 to configure DNS health checks to route traffic to healthy endpoints or to independently monitor the health of your application and its endpoints. Amazon Route 53 Traffic Flow makes it easy for you to manage traffic globally through a variety of routing types, including Latency Based Routing, Geo DNS, and Weighted Round Robin&mdash;all of which can be combined with DNS Failover in order to enable a variety of low-latency, fault-tolerant architectures. Using Amazon Route 53 Traffic Flow&rsquo;s simple visual editor, you can easily manage how your end-users are routed to your application&rsquo;s endpoints&mdash;whether in a single AWS region or distributed around the globe. Amazon Route 53 also offers Domain Name Registration &ndash; you can purchase and manage domain names such as example.com and Amazon Route 53 will automatically configure DNS settings for your domains.",
